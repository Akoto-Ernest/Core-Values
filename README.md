# Core-Values

*Task: Defining Trebnet's Core Values*

*Repository:* Core-Values

*Description:*
At Trebnet, we believe in the importance of strong core values that guide our actions, decisions, and the culture we foster within our community. As part of our commitment to inclusivity and collective ownership, we invite all Trebnet members to contribute to defining our core values.

*Task Objective:*
To collaboratively define the core values that represent what Trebnet stands for and how we operate.

*Task Steps:*

1. 🍴 *Fork the Repository:* Start by forking the "Core-Values" repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

2. 🌿 *Create a Branch:* In your forked repository, create a new branch named after the core value you'd like to propose (e.g., "innovation," "integrity," "collaboration"). 

3. 📜 *Define the Core Value:* In your branch, draft a Markdown file (e.g., `innovation.md`) where you define the core value. Include:
   - A concise definition.
   - A brief description of why this core value is important.
   - How this core value aligns with Trebnet's mission.

4. 📝 *Format:* Use clear and concise language. Feel free to add examples or real-life scenarios that illustrate the core value in action.

5. 💾 *Commit and Push:* Commit your changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository.

6. 🚀 *Create a Pull Request:* In the original "Core-Values" repository, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes from your branch into the main repository.

7. 💬 *Discussion and Feedback:* Engage in discussions within the PR. Encourage feedback and suggestions from other Trebnet members.

8. 🔄 *Refinement:* Revise and refine the core value definition based on feedback. Be open to suggestions and adjustments.

9. 🎯 *Review and Merge:* After adequate discussion and refinement, your core value definition will be reviewed and, if it aligns with Trebnet's mission and culture, merged into the main repository.

*Contribution Guidelines:*

- 💡 Your core value definition should align with Trebnet's values of inclusivity, innovation, and professionalism.
- 💬 Encourage respectful and constructive discussions during the PR process.
- 🚫 Ensure that your contributions are original and do not infringe on copyrights or trademarks.

By involving all Trebnet members in shaping our core values, we can create a more inclusive and values-driven community. Together, we'll define what it means to be a Rebel in Trebnet.

*Deadline:*
The PRs for core value definitions will be open for contributions for 2 days. After that, they will be reviewed, refined, and incorporated into Trebnet's official core values document.
